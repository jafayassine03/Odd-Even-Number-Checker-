# 🎲 Odd & Even Number Checker

Hey there! 👋  
This is a simple **C program** that tells you if a number is **odd** or **even**. Perfect if you're just starting with C and want to play around with numbers.  

Think of it like a little helper that answers: "Is my number even or odd?" 🧐

## 💡 How It Works
1. The program asks you to **enter a number**.  
2. It checks if the number can be divided by 2 without a remainder.  
3. If yes → it prints `even`.  
4. If no → it prints `odd`.  

Simple, right? 😎
